F4: death forecast looks bad because the mort parameters are not time-varying
* Make a decision about: time variation for mortality (but what would be the reason?); drop death (can we find another multi-stream example?)

Testify:
* Are we OK with doing it only on cases?

Fix Rt plot
* Are we changing just Î² (R0(t)), or are we also multiply by S/N (Re(t))? make any decision and state it clearly

Add breakpoints to mobility plot
