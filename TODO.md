## everyone

- what are we including in the actual example?
   - testify?
   - fitting with mobility?
   - fitting with phenomhet?
   - fitting with breakpoints?
   - fitting with splines?

## MLi

- I like it to be a bit more formal with a simulation component with testify.
- See https://github.com/mac-theobio/PHAC_covid/blob/master/reports/McMasterFinalReport2020-08-31.pdf
- todo: locate the code to reproduce the ontario plot in PHAC_covid
- What is the code directory and why is there no Makefile? Are we doing it via the top/main repo?

## JD

- Check "kernel moments calculation" section for accuracy and completeness

## Mike/Irena

- Confirm that description of calibration, forecasting procedure is actually what we are doing
- no process error? 
- ensemble of parameters via MVN sampling? (Importance sampling?)
- NB observation error?
- quantile-based envelopes? (mention Juul et al.?)

## BB

- "ascertainment ratio" is a term I couldn't remember. Use it where appropriate.
- discuss calculation of $R_t$ (i.e., by scaling $R_0$ by $\beta(t)$ ?
