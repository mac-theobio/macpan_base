severely symptomatic relative contact rate,Cs,1,Assume same without intervention,yes,
mildly symptomatic relative contact rate,Cm,1,Assume same without intervention,yes,
Fraction of cases that are asymptomatic,alpha,1/3,,,"Reported as 51.7% for the Diamond Princess in Mizuomoto et al. Eurosurveillance, Reported as 30.8% among Japanese evacuees from Wuhan in Nishiura et al. International journal of infectious diseases"
1/time in exposed class,sigma,1/5.2,,,Drake's code has incubation period of 6 days
1/time for asymptomatic to recover,gamma_a,1/5,,,Drake's code has natural infectious period of 7 days but not sure if that is assumption
1/time for severely symptomatic to be hospitalized,gamma_s,1/5.76,,,"Other values on MIDAS: 1/5.9 (Tindale et al. Singapore), 1/2.7 (Linton et al. China)"
1/time for mildly symptomatic to recover,gamma_m,1/5,,,"Other values on MIDAS: ""time from symptom onset to recover: 22.2, Dorigatti et al.), Drake's code has natural infectious period of 7 days but not sure if that is assumption"
