rExp                    run a pure-exponential sim; uses run_sim_range
                        with a population of 1 (proportions) and a very
                        small starting value, run for 100 steps (by
                        default) used to calculate either r
                        (technically r0) or eigenvector (for
                        distributing initial exposed across states)

restore                 convert a parameter vector back to a structured
                        list Like 'relist', but adds the capability to
                        fill in parameters from a "fixed-parameter"
                        vector

unpack                  unpack a list into the current (calling)
                        environment this is a replacement for 'with()'
                        (which is hard to debug) and 'attach()' (which
                        is frowned upon by CRAN/triggers package-check
                        warnings) (for more traditional Python tuple
                        unpacking see the 'zeallot' package)

update_foi              calculate only updated force of infection at
                        present, this is the only state-dependent _per
                        capita_ rate maybe more efficient than
                        modifying & returning the whole matrix
